# froede

**front + edit + code.** A lightweight toolkit for editing the code behind a running web page or app by clicking on what you see - no diving into the source, no full IDE required.

> **Status: concept / pre-alpha.** This repository currently holds only the initial project structure. No functional code yet.

## The idea

Point at an element on a live page or app, change it - text, style, layout - and have that change land in the real source code. Not in a sandbox. Not through an AI agent as a middleman. Not a throwaway DOM tweak that disappears on reload. As simple and intuitive as a devtools extension, not a full design app.

## Landscape (as of mid-2026)

Before starting, we looked for anything that already does this:

| Project | Open source | Simple / lightweight | Writes back to real source |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Onlook](https://github.com/onlook-dev/onlook) | Yes (Apache-2.0) | No - full editor app, sandboxed web container, Next.js + Tailwind only | Yes |
| [Stagewise](https://github.com/stagewise-io/stagewise) | Yes | Yes - browser toolbar | Indirect - routes through a connected AI coding agent |
| [VisBug](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ProjectVisBug) | Yes (Apache-2.0) | Yes - browser extension | No - ephemeral, DOM-only |
| [GrapesJS](https://github.com/GrapesJS/grapesjs) | Yes (BSD-3-Clause) | No - an SDK for building editors, not an end-user tool | No - export-based |
| [Plasmic](https://github.com/plasmicapp/plasmic) | Split (MIT core / AGPL studio) | No - separate Studio app | Publish-based, not live |
| Chrome DevTools Workspaces | Built-in | Yes | Sources panel only - element/DOM edits aren't saved |

None of them combine "point-and-click simple" with "writes straight to your real source, no sandbox, no AI middleman." That's the gap froede is aiming at.
